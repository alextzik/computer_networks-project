# computer_networks_project-2018
An individual project, part of the 'Computer Networks I' course of the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering 
at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The project consisted of serial communication with a server located at the facilities 
of the department. Echo packets, jpeg files and ARQ-mechanism packets were taken via the link.
Java was used for the implementation of the code for the communication between the server and the computer. 
The two pdf files (sessions) contain the data taken using the link, along with diagrams that show response time and errors (for the ARQ mechanism).
The third pdf contains the analysis of the project in Greek.
